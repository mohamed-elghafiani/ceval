# Ceval

Unlock the power of informed decision-making with Ceval, the advanced circular economy evaluator, seamlessly blending AI efficiency with human expertise to deliver reliable, structured assessments for sustainable solutions.

## Background and Problem Statement

The increasing demand for critical materials, driven by the growth of renewable energy technologies and the expansion of information and communication technologies, poses a significant problem. The circular economy solution, which departs from the linear economic model and encourages the reduction and re-use of products and materials, offers a more effective approach to addressing this problem. By maximizing the retention of economic value in products, materials, and resources over time, CE decouples economic growth from resource depletion, generating significant economic and environmental benefits.

Despite the promise of circular economy solutions in addressing resource challenges, their evaluation presents multifaceted difficulties. One primary challenge lies in the complex and interconnected nature of circular systems. Assessing the environmental, economic, and social impacts across various stages of a product or service life cycle demands a comprehensive approach. Additionally, the integration of insights from diverse assessment methods, such as Life Cycle Assessment, Environmental Extended Input-Output Analysis, and Material Flow Analysis, requires expertise and a nuanced understanding of intricate systems. The dynamic nature of circular economy ideas further complicates assessments, as their effectiveness may evolve over time. Moreover, the subjective nature of some evaluation criteria, such as technological innovation and adherence to circular economy principles, introduces challenges in achieving standardized and objective assessments. Navigating these complexities while ensuring a balanced and accurate evaluation remains a key obstacle in advancing the adoption of circular economy solutions.

## Leveraging Ceval to Navigate Circular Economy Evaluation Challenges

Ceval, our advanced generative AI tool, serves as a powerful ally in overcoming the challenges associated with assessing circular economy solutions. Here are three key features that make Ceval an invaluable asset for enhancing human decision-making:

1. Structured and Comprehensive Assessment with Quantifiable Scores:
   Ceval operates as a circular economy ideas evaluator, enriching human decision-making with a structured assessment process.
   The evaluation of proposed solutions is quantifiable, with scores ranging from 0 to 10 for each of the six metrics: Maturity Stage, Market Potential, Feasibility, Scalability, Technological Innovation, and Adherence to Circular Economy Principles.
   Clear rationales accompany each score, promoting transparency and providing justifications for the assigned numerical values. This ensures a meticulous evaluation process, aiding decision-makers in understanding the basis of each assessment.

2. Multi-Evaluator Board Integration for Reliability:
   The multi-evaluator board is a distinctive feature that enhances Ceval's reliability. This innovative approach overcomes the nuances and biases of language models by simulating the human evaluation process.
   Inspired by human judgment methodologies, the tool prompts the LLM using well-crafted prompts and aggregates diverse viewpoints to arrive at a final decision. This unique combination of AI efficiency and human-like evaluation ensures a more fair, reliable, and unbiased assessment of circular economy solutions.

3. Continuous Improvement through Collaboration with Human Experts:
   Ceval is designed for continuous improvement, working collaboratively with human experts to refine its evaluative capabilities.
   While the tool excels at surfacing non-obvious insights, it acknowledges the irreplaceable value of human experience. Human experts contribute nuanced perspectives, drawing on their extensive experience and domain knowledge.
   This collaborative synergy ensures that Ceval evolves alongside human expertise, enhancing its adaptability and staying attuned to industry nuances. The tool's continuous improvement is a testament to its commitment to providing insightful evaluations that complement and augment human decision-making.
